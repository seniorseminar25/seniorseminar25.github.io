							<h2>Compression Molding and Carbonization Methods</h2>
							<img src="../images/compressionMolder.jpeg" style="width:200px;height:150px">
							<p>To create test coupons, the procedure for compression molding is as follows: first, heat the mold to 190 degrees celcius and hold for 15 minutes to melt the resin and allow for infusion into the fibers. As temperature increases, the resin is partially crosslinking, or b-staging, and this causes the viscosity of the resin to increase. After 15 minutes of melting and partial polymerization, the compression is activated to "wet out" the remaining fibers, and a force of 10 tons is applied. The temperature is brought up to 250 degrees celcius so that the coupon may fully cure and harden. The mold is left under isothermal compression for three hours. After this step, the process is completed, and the mold can be taken out to cool and the coupon is retrieved.<br>After compression molding, parts were de-molded and evaluated for delamination. If delamination did not occur, then post-polymerized parts were cut to dimensions 260mm x 13mm x 1mm using a water-lubricated saw. Parts were then shipped to be carbonized to 1000 degress celcius at 10 degrees per minute under 50mL per minute argon flow in a CM Furnaces Inc. 1730-HT tube furnace.</p>
