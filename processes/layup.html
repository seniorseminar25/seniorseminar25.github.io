							<h2>Layup Procedures</h2>
							<p>Within the mold, three layers of carbon fiber weaves and three layers of resin was chosen. This orientation was
								chosen based on the density of the carbon fiber. The density of the carbon fiber weave used is 1.76 g cm^-3
								, while the
								density of the resin is around 1.12 g cm^-3
								. With the mass from the carbon fiber, the necessary amount of resin can be
								calculated to achieve the necessary 60-40 mass ratio of fibers to resin. However, due to the volume of the carbon fiber
								weaves being unreliable to measure, individual fiber layers were cut out and then weighed in order to determine the
								amount of resin that needed to be used. From the bottom to the top of the mold, the layer order is as follows: fiber, resin,
								fiber, resin, fiber, and finally resin. This was chosen because the resin is in powder form prior to heat pressing, and by
								layering with the resin on top of the fiber, the resin will melt into the fiber. This is to create a more homogeneous piece
								and minimize delamination.</p>
