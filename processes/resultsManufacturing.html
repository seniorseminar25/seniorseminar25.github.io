							<h2>Results of Manufacturing</h2>
							<p>As of date, 5 tests have been performed to create test coupons. Unfortunately, there is no prior basis to compression
                                molding carbon matrix composites, and as such methodologies were formed based on chemical knowledge of BODA
                                resin. Below in table 1, the 5 trials are shown and a description for each. Across all experiments, the most common and
                                devastating issue is resin starvation and wettability. We attribute the problems of the first failures to a combination of
                                excessive heating and miscalculated fiber ply densities.</p>

                            <p>Through trial and error, our methodologies had to change to combat the resin starvation that plagued our first trial
                                experiments in compression molding. Our original methodology consisted of heating the open mold at 200 degrees C
                                for 30 minutes, ramping to 230 degrees C for 30 minutes or until viscous, and then closing the mold while ramping to
                                250 degrees C and applying pressure. This would be held for three hours. The purpose of this methodology was to melt
                                the resin into the plys, partially polymerize to increase viscosity (to prevent flashing of the resin when pressure was
                                applied), and then to fully polymerize or cure into a hardened resin-fiber coupon. The mass calculations were based on
                                the given thickness and cut out dimensions of the carbon fiber plys, as well as the density of the resin. Both the mass
                                calculations and the compression mold schedule resulted in a failure. The carbon fiber plys were dry and loose, and
                                appeared as if they had seen no resin at all. For the second trial, we increased the amount of resin per layer by 25%, but
                                this trial still resulted in resin starvation.<br><br></p>
                            <p>For the third trial, the mass calculations were completely revamped. Once again, mass for resin and plys were
                                calculated via the inner mold volume and a 60 percent mass of fiber to 40 percent mass of resin ratio. These masses
                                represent the “ideal” conditions. Then, the individual carbon fiber plys (cut to dimension) were individually weighed
                                out, and layers were added until the sum of their masses was just below the ideal condition. Based on a fraction of this
                                sum to the ideal condition, then the amount of resin can be calculated by using this fraction to extract the necessary
                                resin values. By dividing this mass by the amount of carbon fiber layers, the amount of resin per layer can be calculated.
                                From these new values, the third trial resulted in only small amounts of visible resin starvation.
